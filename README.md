# cpr

This is essentially a fork of [libcpr/cpr](https://github.com/libcpr/cpr) on GitHub, but with just the libraries and everything we actually need for Operator.

It would probably be better if someone could actually fork the original repo and get Operator running with it (so that we can update things and have more flexibility), but this is what worked for me and I've got little to no experience with library management with CMake.
